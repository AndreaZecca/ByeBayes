# FAIKR3-project
## ByeBayes
Project for the third module of the course Fundamentals of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. The project consists in the construction of a Bayesian network (manually and through sampling) that shows the distribution of the probabilities that lead an individual whose age group and gender are known to death.
This explains the name of the project (ByeBayes)
